This repository is currently licensed under the MIT license. The reason for choosing this license over others, is that I wanted something very simple and permissive. I did not want potential contributors to be worried about restrictions regarding the source code usage/modification. This was a very simple project for me to simulate a wordle-solving algorithm, and I did not have any reason to go with a more restrictive license for something so simple and easy to replicate.
